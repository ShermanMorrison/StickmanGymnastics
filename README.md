Stickman Gymnastics Game in JavaScript

This is a JavaScript re-working of my original Python game, run in CodeSkulptor, an in-browser interpreter.

You can play the in-development JavaScript version at http://jdw7.web.rice.edu/

For the original game in Python, go to http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user26_BNXPhAXkiG_0.py and click the play button.

For a screen cast of game-play, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-gPl4IXpyE
